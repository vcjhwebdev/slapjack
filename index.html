      <h2>Rules of the game</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Clicking on your deck will put a card into play. Your opponent will then put another card in play, and you will continue putting cards into play until a jack appears.</li>
        <li>When a jack appears, you will have to click the cards in play before the computer can!</li>
        <li>Slapping the jack before your opponent will transfer all the cards in play into your deck.</li>
        <li>To win, you must exhaust all of your opponent's cards and transfer the whole deck to your hand by slapping jacks faster than your opponent.</li>
        <li>To start, click on the deck!</li>
      </ul>
